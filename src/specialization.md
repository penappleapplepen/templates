# Template Specialization
- Specialization refers to providing alternative definitions of the template for certain arguments
- There are two types of Specialization
- The definition created from template instantiation is called a specialization too. We can also have custom defined ones
### Partial Specialization
This is an alternative implementation provided for only some of the template parameters
### (Explicit) Full Specialization
